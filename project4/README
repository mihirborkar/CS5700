==================
Challenge
The most challenging part in this project is testing and debugging.
Instead of using Wireshark, we found tcpdump command is more convenient to capture and parse packets. For example,
If I want to capture TCP communication packets between two hosts, I can use the following command:
> tcpdump -XX -i eth0 dst 129.10.113.83
Another useful trick to debug is instrumentation. We instrument some stubs in our code that can output key variables
and monitor the performance when code is running.
